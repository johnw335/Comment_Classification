"Overpowering air fresher smell in restrooms

The automatic air fresheners in all the bathrooms have been changed.  The smell is much more intense.
Some of us myself included are sensitive to chemicals and perfumes. Breathing these chemicals tends to causes us to get sick. sore throats and illness.

Currently the private rest rooms are unusable for me and the larger rest rooms are barley usable.

I suspect that these automatic air fresheners are rated for much larger square footage rooms and should not be used in the small restrooms here.

Your employees should be able the restroom in the office. This is basic.",bathroom
The bathrooms have these new horribly heavy deodorizing machine. It is awful to not be able to go the any bathroom without being chemically assaulted. They don't seems to get it that some people here are very sensitive to chemicals and perfumes. The deodorizers that were in the bathrooms before were perfectly fine. Why they were changed is a mystery.,bathroom
The male toilets are disgusting! Some people don't know how to flush after they did their buiness.,bathroom

Lots of distractions on the 2nd floor,distractions
having 5 people on the same floor on the same call and all on speaker phone is INCREDIBLY distracting. It's strange... don't we have conference rooms that can be turned into war rooms for this kind of thing?,"distractions, noise"

"The Quebec city office workspace need some love. Outside of the new room, everything seems old. Old cubicles and Shakira and Pink poster dating back from the early 2000's. Hard to create hype about that office when we are competing against business that have brand new awesome looking office like Ubisoft, Mirego, Activision, etc.

By the way, why does the employee have to pay for the bus pass but the parking is paid by TM? That make no sense...",equipment

I need snacks....  Can't work with a hungry stomach and low blood sugar. ;),food
"The ""healthy"" snacks that facilities team leaves out are full of salt of sugar. Fruit like apples and bananas would make us feel better throughout the day, is probably cheaper, and would avoid a late afternoon crash. Overall, I'm disappointed with the food situation in Hollywood. The neighborhood is a dump and there are no good options without driving. Can't go anywhere good because meetings are back to back. A 1-hour lunch is a luxury.",food
It's a bit messy for the moment.  Let's organize a clean-up session ;-),Messy
Cleaner kitchen & bathroom would help,messy

Same comment as last week. In the Quebec (US side) office we could probably do something at a fairly low cost to help the team cohesion and communication. An idea would be to remove some of the partitions and reposition reconfigure the desks in order to help with this.,office layout
Would be nice to sit next to the developers and designers I work with,office layout
Conference rooms or lack thereof.,office layout
"Same comment as the previous weeks. 1st step short term low budget: Remove the partitions and re-arrange the desks to help communication and teamwork. Step 2 longer term, invest in the Quebec office space(or move?) to bring it up to par with the competing companies in Quebec in order to be able to attract top talent.",office layout
