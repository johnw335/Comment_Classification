Working from home to avoid traffic jam,commute
I drive long hours to work,commute
"losing 4 hours daily just for driving
 we need  to save the time  at list we can do more tasks",commute
My daily commute is the major concern for me.,commute
"Too much commute (about 6hrs a day) is taking a toll on me.So, 2-3 remote days a week will help.",commute
it is difficult to find the right balance when you spend 12 hours of your waking hours everyday on getting to from and working in the office.,commute
Company policy has changed and its very hard keep up work life balance. Some of us have long commutes and are asked to be available for IT support when needed. Telecommute option should be available.,commute
Early morning meetings are very tough. Traffic is unbeatable and ends up making commuters be in 4+ hours of traffic a day.,commute
"The traffic this week was really annoying, had to drive almost 2 hours to get to the office.",commute
I spent a lot of time in transport and it can be really tiring.,commute
This has become a challenge since the change in office commute,commute
"If you asked me this question several months ago before the changes to the work schedule, I would have said, ""I agree, I have a healthy work life balance"".  But now, it is not the same. It is more stressful to commute everyday.  The energy and the time spend on the commute for the extra 2 days used to be spent on doing more work.  Also, the flexibility of working from home helped to have a healthy and a happy family as well!","commute, flexability "
"The balance has definitely shifted to work, primarily because of the longer commute.  Also, due to team morale and other issues following the office schedule policy change, I find myself ""working"" even when I'm at home, trying to find solutions for the team.","commute, scheduling"
"Since I lost my carpool buddy (he moved to another pod and working from home most of the time), I have spent $15-$18 day to drive in using the express lane.  Even express lane takes >1 hour so financially not making any sense anymore.

I'm going to try WFH twice a week or WFH in the morning and drive in after standup to make good use of my time and $$$.","commute, WFH"
"We just have so many projects and so much work, so many meetings, and not enough time in the day.  Also, though I don't WFH often, having to be in the office by 10AM just means I'm stressed having to fight traffic after morning calls from home and feeling like I'll be scrutinized if I'm a little late getting in to the office.","commute, work load"
"a lot of work, long hours, having to drive into the office during rush hour makes for a long commute, then being in the office late to get work done....not much time at home during the week.","commute, work load"
"Just a personal thing, but I'm struggling with fitting exercise into my life.",exercise
Need more time for running,exercise
Could use a bit more exercise,exercise
I need to come & go at more regular hours.,flexibility
More work from home flexibility (It's just as or more productive anyway),flexibility
Need atleast Friday work from home,flexibility
More rewards during crunch mode,incentives
For the level of pay offered: the amount of hours worked and tasks required are no where near equal,incentives
"Working 9-6 already puts you at a disadvantage for having a good balance. It seems some folks are able to work closer to 9-5 or 10-6, whereas other departments have to hold closer to the 9-6 that is spelled out in the contract. I think yoga has been a big improvement, I'd love to see the NY office have a discount at the nearby Equinox, or other forms of the company supporting health and wellness outside of the office.
If we had more healthy lunches provided or perhaps catered, and we were all were encouraged to sit together away from our desks, I think that would help as well.",incentives
"I don't mind having to take work home if there's just a large volume of it. I do, however, mind taking work home when the root causes are poor planning and coordination, which seems to be the case with alarming frequency.",inefficiency
"Worked until 11pm on VCF last night, then waited at the office for 3 hours, only to be told there was no feedback on our direction and to go home. This process needs to get better.",inefficiency
"More so self-imposed. Every week there are fires, but there's always room for improvement in personal time management. Most times, just has have difficulty prioritizing so that I'm not overwhelmed and working late.","inefficiency, work load"
I have to balance myself,personal
This is on me.,personal
"Not feeling well and my wife is sick too, so feeling little down for the last couple of weeks.",personal
"It's my own fault, part of the time, though.",personal
"No. It's really up to me to balance it. I feel like Paul respects my time difference, too.",personal
"not perfect balance, but that's my fault",personal
That's very personal but this week was special so i brought Emakina with me at home every evenings nights (waking up at night with stress),personal
Need more holidays,scheduling
"Book, unbooked, book, unbooked,... and OTB at the last minute ! So not especially healthy",scheduling
I know it's the stage of the company right now but sometimes things get rescheduled pushed back and unnecessarily turn into fire drills. Okay for now but tough in the long run.,scheduling
Too many meetings and long nights preparing for the meetings. I was also made to feel guilty by my manager for taking time off,scheduling
Still just working on my own personal schedule. Trying to figure it out.,scheduling
Lots of last minutes requests from clients which is leading to very late working hours,scheduling
"This particular week has so far been a bit hectic. Last minute requests have kept me longer at work and as a result, I get home much later than usual. This cuts into the time I spend with my spouse as I have to get to bed early since I get up at 5 am to get to work.",scheduling
"It would be very helpful if the work could start at 8.00 AM and finish at 5 PM.
This schedule would allow more time to finish the tasks from previous day or prepare for the day in a calmer environment (w o calls and e-mails).
It would also provide more time for doing personal tasks after work (for example: shopping) or relaxing at home.",scheduling
Weekend work without super-clear timing and deadlines sometimes makes it feel like I have to be chained to my computer.,scheduling
Last-minute travel is hard,scheduling
"I feel like we have gone from an extremely healthy work life balance to a mandated attendance policy, but there has been no change in expectation of working off hours and 24 7 support. This has decreased my ability to see my children 10 fold.",scheduling
I'm still trying to figure out our vacation policy. Now we have been asked to come into the office 5 days a week. On days where I would normally work from home I would now need to take a vacation day. I have no backup which means I have always been asked to be available on vacation days. Now we are monitoring vacation days even though the company policy states Managers have unlimited vacation. I'm extremely confused about how to handle this.,scheduling
Requests are made after business hours and on weekends with the expectation of having assignments completed outside of work hours.,scheduling
"Life was so good earlier with a 3 day office week. Now, the good is taken out and only life remains.
Earlier it was LIfe for work and not, it is just work. Need to spend more time with family. The change of rule has taken away so much from our lives.",scheduling
"It has been hard to adjust to the new work schedule.  They'v have taken away a great benefit from us and in return we've received free lunch of Wednesdays.  Also, we know that many other groups outside of IT have work from home day on Fridays.  However, the IT group is being punished.","scheduling , incentives"
"This week has been rough, with late nights in the office, lots of meetings, new projects, and terrible morning traffic for the commute.","scheduling, commute"
Need less stress on getting to the office at a particular time. It's very stressful. I'm not sure how I can balance this expectation with my current work load. It's grating at the moment.,"scheduling, work load"
Crazy but good week with on-boardings,temporary
Working on making this better!,temporary
I consider this temporary and necessary.  No complains,temporary
Tough week of changes.,temporary
"DOUREEUUU - make me feel tired ;) but was cool to do.
I was blast to be part of this.",temporary
Just a chaotic week. Lessons learned!,temporary
Really busy past few weeks and it's going to be really busy for a few more.  It's the nature of the job.  Averaged over the year my work life balance is pretty decent.,temporary
It's just a nature of the work cycle. First week of the month is always too busy.,temporary
"This week no work life balance, but it's part of the role ;)",temporary
This week was just very very busy with many project kicking off and a lot of reporting needed at once. Its just that time of year.,temporary
"This week had a specific event that caused some of us to have to work additional hours beyond the scope of the regular day. Hopefully, this is a one-time few-time type event and will not happen again. Since this in regards to my current week, it has factored into my thought about work life balance.",temporary
Temporary issue :),temporary
It is better this week.,temporary

Feeling overwhelmed with the amount of work this week,work load
I think it can be pretty difficult to maintain a healthy work life balance and be a top performer. You could clearly see the top performing AE's were working 2-4 hrs a day more than the other AE's who didn't meet their goal.,work load

Work at night and week end for 7 weeks in a row,work load
"12 hour workdays have become the light ones. The past couple have been more like 18. My outstanding concern with this is the physical toll it takes on me, and I suspect some of my teammates' bodies. Not sure what could be done to solve for this. Better health insurance? Napping rooms? A raise?

All jokes aside I want to be constructive, but think it's fair to just state the affairs. Appreciating the anonymity here as I wouldn't want this interpreted as a complaint. Just some concern over feeling unable to address my basic needs in lieu of work demands.

Thanks for checking in. I appreciate the initiative taken by this platform.","work load, incentives"
Teams are still overworked and much of this comes from the swirl that comes from so many inputs and decision makers. We spend way too much time shopping work internally than actually doing and moving the work.  It's exhausting and unproductive.,"work load, inefficiency"
