"I dont feel that there is team spirit, while developers eventually act and work in the so called CV- development mode. No formal structure, everyone thinks that is an architect, everyone teaches, everyone has an opinion. Everyone dislikes the current difficult - tech debt situation but nobody takes the challenge.  People talk a lot but not act. Also people believe a lot in their given title without eventually adding any value. The easiest thing to do is say I want to do my own thing , or start my own project.",collaboration
I feel like Sam has been distant with some team members. Attitude towards or about users is also something that could be better.,communication
Some communication issues the last couple of weeks,communication
Team partners continue to push the content team to swirl. We have people not acting like 'inputs' but as 'directors'.  Work is spinning. If decision making is at the Sr. level then we need more access to sr leaders. We have too many people who think they are decision makers and no time with the real decision makers. it's nuts the amount of resources we are wasting.,communication
"My Team member is always remote and non-communicative. His task updates are vague and repetitive, and there is no helpful documentation.",communication
I don't feel close to all my teammates.,communication
"Again, special week with bad news to announce and unable to communicate on the next steps",communication
People need to learn how to communicate better and work in teams.,communication
COMMUNICATION IS THE KEY,communication
It seems that we are not aware of what people are doing.,communication
We have a solid team. People need to be more clear and direct and on time with their communication. Too often things are pushed back unnecessarily which delays the whole event process.,communication
I feel sometimes people are not considered of how they come across and how the recipient may be affected,communication
"Overall, yes.

There are a few issues that get churned up into crises even though they were never really issues to begin with. I think this really needs to be addressed, as it adds unnecessary stress and work to the whole team.

I'm still observing people crossing the boundaries of their roles and trying to do the jobs of others. Older members of the team will need to get used to not doing the jobs they once had to do on a smaller team.

Our roles need to get more defined for us to grow and work better as a team. If we all have a job to do, we'll know who is responsible at all times for every phase of the work. Two people trying to do the same job just makes a mess and slows things down.",communication
"I find it very difficult to bond with the rest of the team since I don't speak French or Dutch.
Sometimes even in project-related discussions, some people tend to speak French among themselves, making it not possible for me to participate.",communication
Major lack of communication.,communication
"dev and qa are having issues on process and communication. its frustrating.
i feel ignored sometimes when i try to talk to some people on qa and marketing-dev about improving the processes.",communication
lack of com between people outside of the NYC office,communication
The morning meeting is sometimes going too fast and we don't have time to say everything that needs to be said.,communication
Lack of understanding of my role. They expect immediate answers and do not appreciate how travelling can affect affect speed of communication.,communication
I am satisfied with this but it is really difficult to communicate with people that are not taking the responsibility for what they did didn't do.,communication
"I do not know what my colleague team member is doing. He is permanently working from home in NYC.  He does not post detailed documentation of his tasks. I don't know why he is still working on this team. I believe that my manager has some kind of ties with him, that keeps him on the team.  He could be working another job and we would not know it.",concern about individual
Sam doesn't seem like a team player. At times he won't offer any help to other team members with problems. He's very much in his own world and I can't rely on him for support.,concern about individual
Getting much better. Still struggling talking with Phil.  Dont know why but since he was here before me I always walk on tip toes around him.,concern about individual
Still struggling with one member of my team which takes a lot of time and energy,concern about individual
"Already discussed with manager. No all colleagues, just one. Difficult situation.",concern about individual
One particular team member is never around. Having to pick up the slack,concern about individual
"I question our most recent hires as ""culture fits"". Seems like we're starting to value ""talent"" far more than culture fits, and its ruining our culture.",culture
It's demoralizing how our small team do not share the same mission and our leader is okay with that,different goals
"I feel very comfortable with most colleagues but there have been a number of incidents where I have been really disrespected by some and management has done nothing to address the issue, even after I have asked them to. This results in me continuing to feel uncomfortable with these colleagues as they have been led to believe this is an acceptable way to treat me and at some times have even had their behavior reinforced. Therefore it does become difficult to feel safe and comfortable in my workplace.",disrespect
International cooperation is hard yo.,distance
"My colleague is over 2k miles away and does not share details on what he does, and likes to give orders.","distance, communication "
"It's a little difficult to get responses at times when attempting to interact, but that comes with working remotely from the rest of your team.","distance, communication "
"There is a feeling of disconnection at times, which I know is normal.  I feel more engaged with those who are in my proximity, who have worked along side me and know me better.  These things take time.","distance, communication "
There is lack of direction and the team is dysfunctional.,dysfunction

"There is one person that bothers me (as well as many others), and because he is in a position of power, I feel like there's no way to fix his constant bad attitude and backhanded remarks.

"Within the team I work we get on well. However, I have experienced some frictions with other teams outside of Stoke. In particular, I've recently experienced a situation where another team made criticisms of my team which resulted in some we wished to do being blocked. It was unclear whether this other team had the authority or responsibility to do this. Being fairly new to the company there definitely feels like a Stoke-London thing!",issue with other teams
Local yes. International frustrations,issue with other teams
"This ultimately depends on how you define 'team'. All of the people who report to my same manager are excellent. From a communication standpoint, it's probably the best team I have ever been on in my professional life. Project teams, however, are a different story. Project management in general needs to take a more heavy-handed approach in the process.",issue with other teams
There's no interacting between most colleagues...,not enough interaction

I've also noticed more people are out sick more often, whereas before they might have just WFH through their illness. I think productivity is actually suffering.",stress over new policy
"I don't understand the big push from Nach and Mudy to split the team. We have awesome collaboration with LA so I don't understand at all what they're trying to do ... considering they are not involved at all with the team, they don't participate to DSM, desing meeting and grooming how can they complain if they don't participate.

Let the developers decide how they want to work, we're people ... not resources on a spreadsheet.",stress over new policy
I really do not like seeing a brand new manager came in and wanted or suggest to split the team we put together for 2 years now. A team that works pretty well together. I don't like how this was proposed and communicate at all.,stress over new policy
