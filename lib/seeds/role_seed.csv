The hushed introduction of Lanes has caused lots of confusion and distress, and yet there is still no scheduled announcement. Some of us had expressed tentative interest in working in specific lanes, but at the time there wasn't any context provided (either in terms of H2 priorities, which unbelievably have yet to be shared, or the actual work that would happen in each lane), and it wasn't presented as being a ""final decision"", which is what it seems to be now.",communication issues
