"Not having a boss that understands recruiting or recruiter's pain points leave me with a boss who doesn't and can't fight for tech recruiters. We have many pointless morning meetings with no real objective. I can't think of one good thing that came out of those meetings. In the past, we used to get updates from Mike and Moose. Now, we have a middleman who filters information which often delays overall function, also, the flow of information is not reliable which leads all the recruiters to go back to Moose at the end anyway. This makes things more bureaucratic. Also, my manager's style is very old school dogmatic.",buracratic

I felt discouraged this week that there has been no progress in improving communication after Anita told me  on Monday about the 'up-level' project and forwarded an email where I read that Rich is point person for this project.
------
Point Person:
  A person who speaks for another or for a group
  Related words: front, promoter, shill; communicator, sayer, talker; agent, ...
------
As both my supervisor and as point person, I would hope to hear about this first and first-hand from Rich. I'm curious about the backstory and genesis! I want to hear Rich describe it with enthusiasm!  I would expect Rich
to enlist my support (and that of his other direct reports) and challenge us to do our best to make this a
successful three days. I want to know all these details so I can convey them to my team with enthusiasm and answer their questions...but there has been nothing aside from Anita's remarks and email.

Two months ago, he was furious when one of our colleagues worked from home and didn't tell him and told the team instead. He told us that it makes us look terrible when we all do not know where we all are. Which I think is a fair thing to ask. However, today for example he took off without letting us know that he is OOO. He simply could have sent us a quick calendar invite. He is not living what he is preaching.",micromanaged

Only a leader will provide the strategic direction, support and coaching necessary for each individual.

Also, thinking through the next promotion process, only a TA Leader will be able to have a direct line of sight into each individual's performance, key performance objectives, and what it takes to get promoted. General consensus is that the team is concerned about this lack of insight into each individual's performance and growth plans.",no manager
